# WeatherItsCold-Hot
Weather Dashboard
An application that utilizes the third-party API, OpenWeather, to retrieve weather data for cities and displays the weather (temperature, humidity, and wind speed) of the current day and the weather (temperature and humidity) for the five following days.
This app allows the user to search the weather of a city in the input section and the app will return the current weather along with the future weather for five consecutive days. 
This app should save the search history in the local storage for the user to refer back to and there is a clear button that should clear the history.
